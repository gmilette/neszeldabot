Stupid Greg. Where does he get his info from? Legend of zelda or something?

I'm emotionally weighed down with all the needless death in ukriane and Gaza.  What came I do to help I scream inside.  But first 2 or 3 scoops of suagr in my coffee
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 7:33 AM
The answer was 2

Andrew shows solidarity with gaza’s siege by not using too much sugar
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 7:46 AM
We all know getting diabetes benefits the Jewish insurance companies.   To fight diabetes is to fight the global elites!!!
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:05 AM
Again Brian perks up! (((Elites)))
It looks like the US is softly saying we have our own evidence that it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired and landed in the hospital in Gaza during a barrage aimed at Israel. This matches Israeli statements… again, nobody here is qualified to say for sure, but it’s maybe the real answer. This doesn’t bring back the hundreds killed and maimed but it does underscore how chaotic and difficult it can be to get to the truth in fast-moving situations

Look from my experience in this I didn't see another rocket intercept it before it blew up and landed on the hospital.  The. Whe. It lands it blows up again.  People say the 2nd explosion was the warhead and 1st was the engine blowing yp
In no way could this perfectly postioned camera showing an explosion over a hospital be anything other than luck
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:23 AM
I have no way to verify anything in those videos. I’m going to wait to hear what places like BBC and NYtimes say about them
Scott — Yesterday at 8:24 AM
If it's not in NY Times it's not true, as Adam always says  🙂
Scott — Yesterday at 8:35 AM
I do wonder how many cameras exist in cities just filming forever
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:42 AM
andrew shows scott the live video feeds of "rooms in Greg's house"
Scott — Yesterday at 8:42 AM
"Same angles as my cameras!  What are the odds!"
"How many 'I Love You' Internet teddy bears does he have??"
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:43 AM
it makes sense there would be cell phone video of strikes in Gaza. it's an active warzone with relatively small area and millions of people around. Also, once you start to notice explosions or missiles, many will start to record
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 8:44 AM
Also Isreal most likely has cameras and people everywhere
Brian (person/per) — Yesterday at 8:45 AM
Five Eyes.
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:45 AM
true, israel would already have all manner of cameras set up to notify against incursions.. do they work great always? maybe .. maybe not
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 8:45 AM
The Five Eyes is a coalition of five countries: the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It grew from the 1946 BRUSA agreement, shortly after the end of World War II, to share intelligence and coordinate security efforts.
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:47 AM
israel could also (probably) pinpoint locations of certain arms firings by triangulating infra-red camera footage, if they have multiple angles covering gaza.. and satellites, too
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 8:47 AM
It's not shocking you would want documented evidence of everything done because evwr country around is looking for reasons to atta k you
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:47 AM
the miracle then is why doesn't greg have more cameras outside his house facing out?
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 8:50 AM
For him the cameras are metaphorical.  The issue is inward not outward
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 8:51 AM
I hear you. Tanya installs fake plastic camera shells to ease his anxiety

Human Consciousness Could Be a Side Effect of Entropy, Study Suggests
It's impressive enough that our human brains are made up of the same 'star stuff' that forms the Universe, but a wild study published back in 2016 suggests that this might not be the only thing the two have in common.
Human Consciousness Could Be a Side Effect of Entropy, Study Suggests
It's a limited study and can't be read to deeply but.  If the mind creates the ID from the chaos on information can a robot every do that?  Will it by design be so well organized it will.mimic but never reach the chaotic state needed

Hypothetically, of course!

Did you ask link if you can do this?
Scott — Yesterday at 3:40 PM
Yeah, he meant to say that he is going to play Civ 6 within the lands of TotK
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 3:51 PM
The next time anyone will play a game is retirement or if you bedridden.
Injured greg is the closest right now to this

there's no way greg is still injured, right? @Scott what was the date of his injury?
Scott — Yesterday at 4:34 PM
Discord tells us that Greg told us on 8/26... but it likely happened before that, maybe a few days prior
Pretty sure his doctor is still telling him "just another four weeks!"
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 4:44 PM
I have so many questions about the image but I never realized with that hair brian looks like a modern day hitler
Greg — Yesterday at 4:45 PM
It's not 100% better. But almost. It's been like 9 weeks
Brian (person/per) — Yesterday at 4:45 PM
I'm here to heal, not heil.
Greg — Yesterday at 4:45 PM
Still can't put foot in shoe with it hurting.
So I just need that Brian healing energy and I'm good?
Coldbeef — Yesterday at 4:48 PM
Greg tells the doctor he drinks allot of milk so his dr asks the %.  "100% oat" greg says 
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 4:52 PM

Coldbeef — Yesterday at 5:06 PM
Ugh his body is playing the worst game of tetris.  It's screaming for a long peace of chicken and keeps getting T shaped parsley
Adam 🔵✅ — Yesterday at 5:12 PM

No.
Ingestion of a Pepper X chili causes intense abdominal cramps.

Zeldabot: Legend of Zelda Nes
So, I have been writing zeldabot. A software program that can play Legend of Zelda for Nintendo (NES). It's goal a simple one:
Beat game in under 1 hour 75% of the time.
Addtional rules:
Gather all items: including potion and magic shield
No cheating. No using map tricks to warp. No using any other actions a normal user would not be able to do.

Simple right? So let's design a bot.
Design principles
There are several design principles
Use knowledge to solve problems: There is a lot to know to beat Zelda. Rather than solving all these problems with generic algorithms. I can just type in the information Zeldabot needs, such as the location of the white sword.
There's no AI. Not really. Zeldabot uses the astar search algorithm for routing. Which in 1990 was considered AI. So what I mean here is that zeldabot cannot  use a machine learning approach to solve any problems. 

There are 5 main components of Zeldabot:
Map, Plan, Actions, Bot, Emulator
Let's describe each in turn.
Map
Map contains data about what parts of the world link can walk on. It covers both the overworld map and all 9 levels. The data sources for these are, a CSV of the overworld and handcoded levels data. 
Plan
Objectives: There are a lot of objectives in Zelda. Plan component contains listing of where all the objectives are in the overworld and how to access them. For example one objective is the 100 secret everybody in the south. That can be encoded this way: 

Objective(FramePoint(8.grid, 6.grid), DestType.SecretToEverybody(100, EntryType.Fire(from = Direction.Down)))
This objective is at position 8,6 on the screen. It requires fire to enter, and the bot should shoot the fire downward. 
Hearts, levels, and shops are encoded similarly. In all there are about 60 objectives.
Plan
Zeldabot has encoded plans for the overworld and each level. The overworld plans mainly consist of specifying the sequence of objectives to acquire such as this sequence

phase("grab hearts")
obj(Dest.Secrets.fire30GreenSouth)
obj(Dest.Heart.fireHeart)
obj(Dest.Secrets.bombHeartSouth)
obj(Dest.Secrets.forest100South)
obj(Dest.Shop.arrowShop)
obj(Dest.Heart.ladderHeart)
Zeldabot does this sequence after beating levels 1–4. It's time to collect some hearts and items before continuing on to the rest of the levels. The plan specifies the sequence of objectives to achieve.
But how does the bot know how to move from one objective to another? There is an overworld router that routes the bot between screens using a shortest path algorithm. No big deal. 
Level plans require more fine detail. While the overworld is mostly the same, travel between locations, the level plans require link to do a variety of actions within each location. Here is an example of the level 1 plan:
left
up
up
seg("get key from skeletons")
kill
goTo(InLocations.Level1.key83)
seg("Bomb and move")
bomb(InLocations.topMiddleBombSpot)
up
This plan tells the bot how to move, starting left, then up, then up. It then names the next part "get key from skeletons" This requires killing all of them, so the kill action is used. Then goTo action makes the zeldabot move to a certain location to acquire the key. From there it has to bomb to move up.
What are all these actions like up and kill and bomb? that is the 3rd component of zeldabot: Actions
Actions
The plan gets zelda to move between locations, and then specifies which actions to perform in those locations. Zeldabot therefore, needs to specify which actions link can perform.
Here are some examples:
KillAll: kill all enemies within a location.
Move: Move in a direction
Bomb: drop a bomb to move
Loot: Grab those rupees!
There are also some specialized actions such as "kill ganon" and "kill arrow spider" which are needed for particularly difficult locations. 
There is great fun in writing these and trying to get the algorithm right so that link can accomplish the action without too much hurt. For example, what is the proper level of aggressiveness while trying to move between map locations? Should link always kill everything or should it only kill a monster when it gets close?
Routing Algorithm
To make these actions work, a routing algorithm is required.
The routing algorithm allows an Action to determine a path between two points on the screen. It uses an algorithm called a* which finds optimal paths between points. It uses a cost function to describe how costly it to move on a certain point. This is very useful for zeldabot.
Imagine if zeldabot wants link to move from its current location to 128, 96 to collect a key. The routing algorithm can determine that link should start by moving left, for example. 
There are a few complications that make this routing difficult. 
Obstacles: There may be obstacles between where link is and the key is. These are information provided by the map. The routing algorithm is able to route around those. 
Enemies: here could be enemies too. That's where the cost function comes into play. The routing algorithm makes is more costly to walk on an enemy. Hopefully, this encourages routes that avoid enemies. 

In this picture you can see the purple squares show locations that have higher costs that link can avoid.
A plan consist of the list of actions Zeldabot will perform. In its current implementation there are are 1171 of them. All hand coded with care. Using the plan, Zeldabot can go through each one and rescue the princess!
ZeldaBot and Emulator
It could be a great plan but what is going to run it? well that is the function of the Zeldabot and Emulator. These engage in an iterative loop until Gannon is defeated and the princess is saved. Zeldabot uses the excellent Nintaco emulator (https://nintaco.com/).
Zeldabot interaction with Emulator

Zelda receives state from the emulator. This is really just a bunch of hexidecimal memory values. To make sense of these, Zeldabot has a state interpreter which finds the relevant values in memory and passes them to the next action. This action generates a game pad movement. Bot then passes the gamepad movement to the emulator, and the emulator simulates the next step. This generates a new state for the bot. and so on. 
Performance?
So how does it perform? Well. It can beat the game, but has not yet fast enough or without cheating. It currently needs to have infinite life, bombs, and rupees. It also needs to have some manual interventions in order to prevent it from getting stuck in different parts of the map. But zeldabot keeps improving.
What else?
Now that I have an automated way to play zelda. There are many questions that can be answered by running experiments such as:
What is the optimal plan?
Which keys are worth getting based on time to acquire them?
What is the optimal strategy for defeating the rhino in level2?
Please follow the youtube channel below as I attempt to make this vision a reality.
